# IMDB API
Deployment link: https://openimdb.herokuapp.com/  

An IMDB RESTful API developed using the Atom text editorm, written using Node.js, and implementing a MongoDB database hosted on mLab. I am using express to create and postman to test the various CRUD methods for the api's given routes and have obtained my dataset from https://datasets.imdbws.com/.

# How to Use
You can search for various media titles via the REACT driven front-end or use the various api routes to get/post/put/delete JSON objects for the different kinds of media stored on the MongoDB.
